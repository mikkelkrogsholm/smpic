Title: Creates Images Sized for Social Media
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mikkel Freltoft Krogsholm
Maintainer: Mikkel Freltoft Krogsholm <mikkel@56n.dk>
Description: Creates images that are the proper size for social media. Beautiful
    plots, charts and graphs wither and die if they are not shared. Social media 
    is perfect for this but every platform has its own image dimensions. With 
    smpic you can easily save your plots with the exact dimensions need for the 
    different platforms.
